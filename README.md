FirmataStepper
==============

Standalone version of the Stepper library provided with AdvancedFirmata.

FirmataStepper controls [bipolar](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/StepperBipolarCircuit) and [unipolar](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/StepperUnipolarCircuit) stepper motors in both two-wire
and four-wire configurations. It can also control step + direction drivers
such as the [EasyDriver](http://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/).

The library also supports acceleration and deceleration of the motor.

To Use
---

Clone or download and copy FirmataStepper into your Arduino libraries 
directory. Open in the Arduino IDE, select File -> Examples -> FirmataStepper
and select one of the examples.

If you download rather than clone this repository, rename the folder to 
"FirmataStepper" after unzipping and before copying into your Arduino libraries
directory.
